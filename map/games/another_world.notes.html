Another World 3.7.0 - Using custom map of Arnay

		<br>	<b>UNITS</b>
		<br>	When units are displayed in the production window or the unit help screens, the game engine does not consult support attachments or terrain effects.  Some other special features of units are not listed in these screens either.  Since Ascending Powers makes extensive use of these things, the descriptions shown here should be used to get a complete and accurate list.  All units are the same from one nation to another.
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Ground Units</b>
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Population </b>
		<br>	<b>Cost: 6 </b>(Are generated automatically each turn, one for each land territory and one for each city level you own.)
		<br>	<b>Attack: 0 </b>

		<br>	<b>Move: 1 </b>
		<br>	<b>Transport Cost: 1 </b>- On sea by transport ship or merchant ship.  Can be transported by air by helicopters and transport planes.
		<br>	<b>Placement: </b>Any land territory owned at the start of the turn, up to 5 per territory.
		<br>	<b>Special: </b>When located in your capital, can be converted to 2 PUs each.  When located in a foreign capital, may be transferred to that player.  Structures such as city levels, factory levels, airfields, harbours, forts, fortresses, bunkers, and nuclear facilities require the presence of population units and consume them on placement.  Population can repair damage on structures.  Population can be strategic bombed and are killed when receiving 1 hit.

		<br>
		<br>	<b>Additional Game Notes: </b>
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Dice:</b>
		<br>	1. 	Twelve sided dice are used for all combat die rolls, and unit battle strengths have been adjusted and scaled accordingly.  A number of new units have been added, taking advantage of 
		<br>		the greater variety of battle strengths available.  As of this version, all units can be built immediately but the intention is for later versions to make more advanced units
		<br>		dependent upon technology research, and stopping the production of obsolete units.
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Starting Positions:</b>
		<br>	2.  There are 18 playable countries, each starting with one capital. Every capital territory produces 15 PUs per turn.  Every player begins the game with 10 infantry, 15 population,
		<br>		a level 5 city, a level 5 factory, 5 bunkers, an airbase, and a harbour in their capital, and in the sea adjacent 1 Destroyer and 1 Transport.  In addition, 10 infantry are in each colony.
		<br>		Every player starts with 20 PUs in the bank.  Although every starting position is equal in all of these respects, some are more challenging to play due to proximity to other players,
		<br>		geographic advantage, and better access to the sea (although every starting position and colony is adjacent to the sea).
		<br>
		<br>		The loss of a capital is serious, but no longer catastrophic (players still receive their income and can produce units if they have cities and/or factories elsewhere).  However,
		<br>		capitals are the only locations where population units can be transferred and/or sold, and, of course, in the early stages of the game they are critical to production and growth.
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Convoy Zones & Merchant Ships:</b>
		<br>	3. 	Each player has a convoy zone located as close as possible to their capital which earns them 15 PUs per turn unless the interdicted by another player's navy.  Interdicting (moving war ships
		<br>		into the space stops it's production (the interdicting player does NOT receive the income) until the interdiction is removed by the owning (or allied) player's navy re-occupying the zone.
		<br>
		<br>		Players can build merchant ships which can expand their income.  Each sea zone occupied by at least one merchant ship will provide income for the occupying player(s).  Because some
		<br>		players have easier access to the sea, the income produced is different for some countries.  Merchant ships have no battle strength and will be destroyed if undefended in a battle.
		<br>		Merchant ships also have 2 transport capability, which allows them to transport population, which have a transport cost of 1, and marines which have a transport cost of 2.
		<br>
		<br>				Archenland, Loch Island, Maflemia, Narsia, Nylita, and Sharn:		3 PUs per zone
		<br>				All Others:															2 PUs per zone
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Political Relationships:</b>
		<br>	4.	All countries start the game neutral to each other.  There are 9 relationships possible in the game: Allied, Aligned, Friendly, Cooperative, Uncommitted, Uncooperative, Unfriendly, Hostile, and War.
		<br>		Relationships can be changed one step up or down if they have existed long enough (One turn for uncommitted, two turns for cooperative or uncooperative, three turns for friendly or unfriendly, and four
		<br>		turns for aligned or hostile).  Changing a relationship up requires acceptance of the other player, but changing down a step does not.  If a relationship becomes that of either allied
		<br>		or war, it is permanent for the rest of the game. Relationships better than uncommitted offer progressive benefits, ranging from using each other's canals, overflying each other'same
		<br>		territories, open borders, and exchange of population.  Hostile relationships are the same as war except they are not permanent, and similarly aligned relationships are like being allied.
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Neutral Territories:</b>
		<br>	5.	At the start of the game, most territories are neutral, but contain a defensive garrison in ratio to their PU value.  They can be freely attacked by any player at any time.
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Transport</b>
		<br>	6.	Transport ships can carry 9 tons (more than most versions of TripleA games), and carriers can hold more air units as well.  
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Air Units Range</b>
		<br>	7.	Most air units have very short ranges until staged on carriers or with airfields.  
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Leadership</b>
		<br>	8.	Generals and admirals give a +1 bonus to all units they accompany.
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Paratroopers</b>
		<br>	9.	All countries start with paratrooper technology researched.  Helicopters and transport planes can carry infantry or marines.
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Nuclear Missles</b>
		<br> 	10.	Nuclear missles have been added that destroy a percentage of all units in the same territory.  They are expensive as they are only meant for countering huge unit stacks.  They have a range of 4 and can suicide and kamikaze.  They can be carried on nuclear subs and/or carriers.
		<br>
		<br>	<b>Turn Sequence</b>
		<br> 	11.	Each player's turn sequence begins with collecting income (the display window says "end of turn" but it is actually the beginning), followed by user actions, political actions, tech development,
		<br>		purchasing units, combat movement, non-combat movement, and unit placement.
		<br>
