<br>This is an 18 player FFA map with all players neutral to each other at the start.  Players can change their political
<br>stance toward other nations, from neutral to cooperative, friendly, aligned and allied or to uncooperative,
<br>unfriendly, hostile, and permanent war.  Every nation starts with the same units but a different geographic
<br>in a completely custom world.
<br>
<br>Grow your population, build cities and factories, expand militarily, and use diplomacy to advance your
<br>nation to supremacy.  Develop nuclear capabilities, control the seas, and use canals to out-manuever your
<br>enemies.  Units fight and move differently depending on terrain.  Use generals and admirals.
<br>Neutral units control most of the land at the start, some are very difficult to defeat.
<br> In addition to resources from gaining territory, use merchant ships to gain income from trade.
